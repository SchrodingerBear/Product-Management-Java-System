# Product-Management-Java-System (CAPSTONE PROJECT)
LapuLapu FoodHauz Baguio is a knowned shop located near PHISCI in Baguio, Philippines. This capstone project is a Java-based system that was custom-made for the shop's daily operations. While further development is possible, it is not deemed necessary at this time. I am proud to present this as my First Capstone Project during my First Year in college, and it was developed solely by me
